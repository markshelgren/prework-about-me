  <h2>The man</h2>
  <p>
    Born in 1945 Van heard his Shipyard worker father’s collection of blues, country and gospel early in life. Feeding
    off musical greats such as Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Muddy Waters, Mahalia Jackson and Leadbelly he was a
    travelling musician at 13 and singing, playing guitar and sax, in several bands, before forming the band Them in
    1964.
  </p>
  <p>
    Making their name at Belfast’s Maritime Club, Them soon established Van as a major force in the British R&B scene.
    Morrison’s matchless vocal and songwriting talents produced instant classics such as the much covered ‘Gloria’ and
    ‘Here Comes The Night’.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those talents found full astonishing range in Van’s solo career. After working with Them’s New York producer Bert
    Berns on beautiful Top 40 pop hit ‘Brown Eyed Girl’ (1967), Morrison moved to another realm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recorded over 3 days with legendary jazz musicians Astral Weeks (1968) is a still singular album combining street
    poetry, jazz improvisation, Celtic invocation and Afro Celtic Blues wailing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Morrison would weave these and myriad other influences into the albums that followed in quick succession.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reflecting on new life in America on the joyous Sinatra soul of Moondance (1970) and the country inflected Tupelo
    Honey (1971) he summoned old spiritual and ancestral life in the epic St Dominic’s Preview (1972) closer track
    Listen To The Lion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Double live album Too Late To Stop Now (1973) highlighted Morrison’s superlative performing and bandleader skills.
    Mapping out a richly varied musical course throughout the 70s he shone among an all-star cast including Bob Dylan
    and Muddy Waters on The Band’s Last Waltz.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, borne of his Irish Showband instincts, the magic of the live performance has been a consistent feature of
    Morrison’s career.
  </p>
  <p>
    Settling back into life in the UK in 1980 he released Common One an album centring on Summertime In England an
    extraordinary invocation of literary, sensual and spiritual pleasure the song would often become a thrilling
    improvised centrepiece to his live shows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Steering his own course throughout the 80s on albums such as No Guru, No Method, No Teacher he claimed Celtic roots
    with The Chieftains on Irish Heartbeat. Teaming with Georgie Fame brought new impetus to his live show while Avalon
    Sunset saw him back in the album and single charts by the decades end.
  </p>
  <p>
    Van Morrison continued to advance on his status as a game- changing artist through the 90s and into the 21st
    century.
  </p>
  <p>
    Awards and accolades - a knighthood, a Brit, an OBE, an Ivor Novello, 6 Grammys, honourary doctorates from Queen’s
    University Belfast and the University of Ulster, entry into The Rock n Roll Hall of Fame and the French Ordres Des
    Artes Et Des Lettres - attested to the international reach of Van’s musical art.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet there was never any suggestion that Morrison, one of the most prolific recording artists and hardest working
    live performers of his era, would ever rest on his laurels.
